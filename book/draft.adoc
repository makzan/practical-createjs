What if I donâ€™t use CoffeeScript?






Why still Adobe Flash?

Exporting shape from flash

After draw the shape, make the complex shape as a movie clip symbol. Give it a name. Then you can either use it by creating a new instance or using its instance name directly if it is already on the stage.


Why flash?

Flash is dead as a player. But it is still a very good authoring tool to create vector animation.

I believe we have a lot to learn from the workflow of flash authoring.

It's symbol. Hierarchy. Instance. Tweening.




DrawScript

Allow drawing the vector in Adobe Illustrator and exporting the shape into EaselJS shape drawing.
