## 2. Page Transition Manager

In this step, we control our `.page` DOM elements by a `PageManager`.

### Preparation

We need to modify the scenes management. It was controlling the `DisplayObject` in CreateJS canvas. Now we need to control the DOM elements. I changed the class from `SceneManager` to `PageManager` to make the code less confusing. The structure will be the same as what we had in canvas-based scenes manager.

	class app.PageManager
	  constructor: (@stage)->
	    # init the pages
	  lastScene: ->
	    # return last scene
	  resetWithScene: (scene) ->
	    # reset scene
	  popScene: ->
	    # remove the last scene
	  pushScene: (scene)->
	    # show the given scene
	  pushSceneWithTransition: (scene, transitionClassName) ->
	    # show the given scene with transition




### Time for Action

1. First, we work on the CSS. Each page is absolute positioned

	{title="app.css"}
		/* canvases sit inside the #app frame. It’s similar to layers. */
		#app {
		  position: relative;
		}
		#app > canvas {
		  position: fixed;
		  display: none; /* default hide until we use it */
		  z-index: 999;
		}

		/* Page related */
		.page {
		  width: 100%;
		  height: 100%;
		  position: absolute;
		}

2. By default, we hide all the `.page`. The first page will be added from the `resetWithScene` method.

	{title="page-manager.coffee"}
		constructor: (@stage)->
		    @scenes = []
		    $('.page').hide()

		    # register clicks on all pages
		    $('a[href^="#"]').click (event) =>
		      pageId = $(event.currentTarget).attr('href')

		      # when it's link to #, it is a back transition
		      pageId = '.page:first' if pageId == '#'

		      transition = $(event.currentTarget).data('transition')

		      @pushSceneWithTransition $(pageId), transition

3. The `lastScene` returns the last element of the `scenes` array.

	{title="page-manager.coffee"}
		lastScene: -> @scenes[@scenes.length-1]

4. In the `resetScene` method, we reset the scenes array and use jQuery to show the given scene.

	{title="page-manager.coffee"}
		resetWithScene: (scene) ->
		  @scenes.length = 0
		  @scenes.push scene

		  $(scene).show()

5. When we remove scene, we don’t actually remove the scene like we did in canvas. Instead, we hide the DOM element of the scene.

	{title="page-manager.coffee"}
		popScene: ->
		  $(scene).hide()
		  @scenes.pop()

6. In DOM elements, we control the DOM’s visibility. So pushing a scene means we hide the last one and show the given one. The browser may be scrolled in the last scene, that’s why we reset the scroll position.

	{title="page-manager.coffee"}
		pushScene: (scene)->
		    $(@lastScene()).hide()
		    @scenes.push scene
		    $(scene).show()

		    # reset the scroll
		    $(window).scrollTop(0)

7. Here comes the core part, transition. The transition is still controlled by canvas. During the control of the DOM visibility, we show the canvas animation and hide the canvas after the transition completed.

	{title="page-manager.coffee"}
		  pushSceneWithTransition: (scene, transitionClassName='TransitionAnimationB') ->
		  transition = new lib[transitionClassName]()

		  # The demension follows the Flash canvas dimension
		  transition.x = 300/2
		  transition.y = 400/2
		  $('#app-canvas').show()

		  transition.on 'sceneShouldChange', =>
		    @pushScene scene

		  transition.on 'transitionEnded', ->
		    $('#app-canvas').hide()

		  @stage.addChild transition

8. Let’s make use of the page transition. We change the `app.coffee` to the following code.

	{title="app.coffee"}
		# a global app object.
		this.exampleApp ?= {}

		# alias
		cjs = createjs
		setting = this.exampleApp.setting
		app = this.exampleApp

		class App
		  # Entry point.
		  constructor: ->
		    console.log "Welcome to my portfolio."

		    @canvas = document.getElementById("app-canvas")
		    @stage = new cjs.Stage(@canvas)

		    cjs.Ticker.setFPS 60
		    cjs.Ticker.addEventListener "tick", @stage # make sure the stage refresh drawing for every frame.

		    app.sceneManager = new app.PageManager(@stage)
		    app.sceneManager.resetWithScene $('.page:first')

		new App()

### What just happened?

We created the page transition manager that is very similar to our previous scene manager. The only difference is that page manager handles `.page` DOM element and scene manager handles CreateJS container.



### Improvement

We have reset the scroll position during scenes transition. In future, we may store the scroll position of each scene, so that we can resume the previous scroll position when popping to the last scene.
