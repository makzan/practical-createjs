## 7. Aligning with FlexBox

Flexbox is the next hot topic on layout. Itâ€™s draft was first published in 2009 and has reach a relatively stable status now, after 5 years of discussions and name changes.

In the step, we will make the app frame a flexbox container and layout our user interface elements at the center of the screen, vertically.



### Time for action

1. Add the following to the CSS to make the items align center vertically.

	{title="app.css"}
		/* Flexbox */
		html, body, #app, .page {
		  height: 100%;
		}
		.page {
		  flex-direction: column;
		  display: flex;
		  align-items: center;
		  justify-content: center;
		}

I recommend reading the [full guide to FlexBox](http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/). Or you may check the latest working draft on W3C website.
