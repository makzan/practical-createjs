== Step 3: Mocking API

We need to use different API response to test our logic.

Mocking an API usually means that we create a static JSON file and put it somewhere that the development app can access. But this could be more automatic if we have lots of mock API to create. A tool named http://mockable.io[mockable] comes to help.

I created 2 canned responses, sunny and rainy, with the following URL. The response JSON is copied from the source, OpenWeather.

=== Time for Action

1. In the `Data` class, we add a mock API to test different API response. Add the following code to override the API url.
+
.app.coffee
[source,coffeescript]
----
class Data
  constructor: ->
    @api = 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Macao,MO'

    # mock
    @api = 'http://demo5385708.mockable.io/weather?rainy'
  ...
