== Step 7: Aligning with FlexBox

Flexbox is the next hot topic on layout. Itâ€™s draft was first published in 2009 and has reach a relatively stable status now, after 5 years of discussions and name changes.

In the step, we will make the app frame a flexbox container and layout our user interface elements at the center of the screen, vertically.


=== Time for action

1. Add the following to the CSS to make the items align center vertically.
+
.app.css
[source,css]
----
/* Flexbox */
html, body, #app, .page {
  height: 100%;
}
.page {
  flex-direction: column;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
----
