== Step 6: Moving the canvas in


=== Time for Action

This is a subtle effect that we move the canvas icon from bottom to the center of the viewport by using CSS3 transition.

.app.css
[source,css]
----
.out {
  transform: translateY(100%);
  opacity: 0;
}

.in {
  transition: all .75s cubic-bezier(0.140, 0.460, 0.160, 1.210);
  transform: translateY(0%);
  opacity: 1;
}
----

The transition may fail if the data is cached without loading. We need to add a little delay to make the CSS transition work.

[source,coffeescript]
----
class App
  constructor: ->
    console.log "Do you need your umbrella today?"

    setTimeout =>
      @refresh()
    , 500
----
