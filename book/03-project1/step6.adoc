== Step 6: Animating transition between scenes

In this step, we make use of the exported Flash animation to build the animated transition effect.

=== Preparation

Before we begin, make sure we have the `transitions.js` file ready in the `scripts` folder. We include the file into the `index.html` before loading our main App logic.

.index.html
[source,html]
----
...
  <script src="http://code.createjs.com/easeljs-0.7.1.min.js"></script>
  <script src="http://code.createjs.com/tweenjs-0.5.1.min.js"></script>
  <script src="http://code.createjs.com/movieclip-0.7.1.min.js"></script>
  leanpub-start-insert
  <script src="scripts/transitions.js"></script>
  leanpub-end-insert
  <script src="scripts/app.js"></script>
</body>
----

NOTE: If you have modified the animation in Flash, you need to publish the Flash document again to update the JavaScript file.

=== Time for Action

Let’s work on the following steps to add the animated transition to the app.

1. In the `scene-manager.coffee`, we add one new method `pushSceneWithTransition` which add the animated transition while switching scenes.
+
.scene-manager.coffee
[source,coffeescript]
----
this.exampleApp.sceneManager = {
  ...
  pushSceneWithTransition: (scene, transitionClassName) ->
    transition = new lib[transitionClassName]()
    transition.x = setting.width/2
    transition.y = setting.height/2

    scene.visible = false

    @pushScene scene

    # The transition animation in Flash should dispatch `sceneShouldChange` event.
    transition.on 'sceneShouldChange', ->
      scene.visible = true

    @stage.addChild transition
}
----

2. In the `scenes.coffee`, we change to use the new `pushSceneWithTransition` method.
+
.scenes.coffee
[source,coffeescript]
----
class SceneA extends Scene
  constructor: ->

...
info.on 'click', ->
  scene = new SceneInfo()
  sceneManager.pushSceneWithTransition scene, 'TransitionAnimationA'

...
photoA.on 'click', ->
  scene = new SceneB('a')
  sceneManager.pushSceneWithTransition scene, 'TransitionAnimationB'

...
photoB.on 'click', ->
  scene = new SceneB('b')
  sceneManager.pushSceneWithTransition scene, 'TransitionAnimationB'

...
photoC.on 'click', ->
  scene = new SceneB('c')
  sceneManager.pushSceneWithTransition scene, 'TransitionAnimationB'
----

=== What just happened?

We have added a custom animated transition when we switch scene in the app.

==== Adding the generated transition

Any exported Flash movieclip is put into a `lib` namespace. For example, if the movieclip name is `AnimatedBall`, we can create an instance by using `new lib.AnimatedBall()`.

In our code, the transition class name is a variable. By using the array notation instead of dot notation, we can create new instance of a class where the class name is variable.

[source,coffeescript]
----
new lib[transitionClassName]()
----

==== Custom event: sceneShouldChange

In the scene manager, we listen to the `sceneShouldChange` event and toggle the new scene’s visibility.

[source,coffeescript]
----
transition.on 'sceneShouldChange', ->
  scene.visible = true
----

This relies on the Flash animation which dispatches the event at the middle of the transition animation.

In the screenshot, you will find an action is defined in the middle of the transition animation. When the animation reaches this frame, it dispatch the event. We capture this custom event in the scene manager to actually switch the scene.
