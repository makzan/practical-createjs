== Project Preparation

Throughout the project, we need several graphic files to complete the
project. Please download the files via the following link.

After you downloaded the file, you will see the following files in the bundle.

The `transitions.js` file is the animated transition exported from the Adobe Flash. If you don’t have the Adobe Flash, you can just use this file who comes with 2 transitions to follow the example. If you have Flash, however, you can open the `transitions.fla` file and customize the transition animation. You may even create new transition effects. We will talk about this later.
