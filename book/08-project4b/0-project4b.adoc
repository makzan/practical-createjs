Drawing chart is one of the common canvas usage.



== Further challenges

We have discussed the usage of gyroscope sensor in the chapter _Rain or Not_. What if combine what I have learned there with the chart drawing together? Try creating an inspector as following that shows the value history of the sensor.

You can test the real application by using the following links with your devices.

- Gyroscope Rotation: http://mztests.herokuapp.com/rotation/
- Accelerometer: http://mztests.herokuapp.com/motion

The rotation value ranged from -365 to +365. When we use the following chart, the rotation value shows as a history for better inspection.
